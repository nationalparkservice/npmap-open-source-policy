# NPMap open source policy

This repository contains the official [Open Source Policy](policy.md) of [NPMap](http://www.nps.gov/npmap/) (a digital mapping team within the [National Park Service](http://www.nps.gov/)).

**[Read NPMap's open source policy.](policy.md)**

### NPMap team guidance

For NPMap team members, we have guidance on how NPMap puts this policy into practice, and how we handle the narrow situations where we may delay or withhold the release of source code.

### Credits

This policy was originally forked from [18F's policy](https://github.com/18F/open-source-policy/), which was, in turn, forked from the [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's policy](https://github.com/cfpb/source-code-policy). Thanks also to [@benbalter](https://github.com/benbalter) for his [insights regarding CFPB's initial policy](http://ben.balter.com/2012/04/10/whats-missing-from-cfpbs-awesome-new-source-code-policy/).

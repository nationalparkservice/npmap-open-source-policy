# NPMap Open Source Policy

This repository contains the [Open Source Policy](policy.md) of the [NPMap team](http://www.nps.gov/npmap/), which is part of the [U.S. National Park Service](http://www.nps.gov/) (NPS).

**[Read NPMap's open source policy.](policy.md)**

### NPMap team guidance

For members of the NPMap team, we have guidance on how NPMap puts this policy into practice and how we handle the narrow situations where we may delay or withhold the release of source code.

### Credits

This policy was originally forked from [18F's policy](https://github.com/18F/open-source-policy/), which was, in turn, forked from the [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's policy](https://github.com/cfpb/source-code-policy). Thanks also to [@benbalter](https://github.com/benbalter) for his [insights regarding CFPB's initial policy](http://ben.balter.com/2012/04/10/whats-missing-from-cfpbs-awesome-new-source-code-policy/).
